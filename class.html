            I wandred lonely as a cloud
            thet floats on high  o'er values and hills' 
            when all at once I saw a croud,
            A host, of golden daffodills;
            beside the lake, beneath the tress, 
            fluttering and danind in the breeze . <br>  
       
            Continuous as the stars that shine 
            and twinkils on the milky way, 
            they stretched in never-ending line 
            along the margin of bay: 
            ten thousand saw I at a glance 
            tossings their heads in sprightly dance. <br>
        
            the waves beside them danced; but they 
            out-did the sparkling waves in glae;
            a poet could not but be gay,
            In such a jocund company: 
            I gazed-and gazed-but littel thought
            what wealth the show to me had brought: <br>
       
            for oft,when in my couch I like 
            in vacent or in pensive mood, 
            they flash upon that inward eye 
            which is the bliss of solitudes;
            And dances my neart with pleasure fills,
            And dance with daffodills. <br>
